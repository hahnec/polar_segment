# polar_segment

This is a polarimetric image segmentation framework developed for brain tumor identification. This framework uses the `TumorMeasurementsCalib` and the more recent and refined `NPP dataset` containing per-pixel Mueller matrices of ex-vivo brain tissues. Nonetheless, swapping the dataset loading file `horao_dataset.py` with your custom dataset shall be possible as long as the labels of the new dataset are arranged accordingly.
